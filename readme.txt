source code for the solution of the bile flow differential equations for the article: 3D spatially-resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue reveal new aspects of NAFLD progression https://doi.org/10.1101/572073

the program has no input parameters, data specific to a sample is condensed in text files with the prefic input_ 

there are two such input files given in the repository, one for a normal control, one for a steatosis patient

the name of the input file along with the directory has to be written directly into the source code in the rather short main() function.
